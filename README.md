> Tasking application for developers

A task manager that helps a developer focus on coding instead of deciding what to work on.  Utilizes a Markdown editor to help create a 
better UX for the user

## Usage example

Developer is in need to organize specific tasks to help with workload management and prioritizing specific features and business logic.
A user can create tasks and assign specific attributes to said task in order to help them with their workflow

> Example Cases:
> - Given a specific business need, a feature or bug fix may be required by next week,  a user can create tasks and assign a target date with a specific priority.
> - While working on a feature, small bugs are found during the development phase and to document them, a user can create new tasks with low priorities to be fixed at a later time.
> - The next day, a pull request goes through the automated testing suite and a major bug is found.  User will create a high priority task and focus on said major bug.
> - While sorting the tasks by priority and progress, a user can work and maintain focus on urgent tasks
